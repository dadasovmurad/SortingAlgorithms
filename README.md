## About the Algorithms

### Bubble Sort

Bubble Sort is a comparison-based sorting algorithm. At each step, adjacent elements are compared and placed in the correct order. The largest element slowly "bubbles up" towards the end of the array, like big bubbles rising in water. This process is repeated until the entire array is sorted.

### Insertion Sort

Insertion Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that is efficient for small data sets. It is considered an in-place sorting algorithm, meaning it doesn't require any additional data structures. The algorithm treats the array as two partitions: the sorted and the unsorted. Each element in the unsorted partition is "inserted" into the sorted partition in the correct position. This process continues until there are no elements left in the unsorted partition.

### Selection Sort

Selection Sort is a simple sorting algorithm that repeatedly finds the minimum (or maximum) element from the unsorted part of the array and swaps it with the first unsorted element. The algorithm maintains two partitions: the sorted and the unsorted. The smallest element is selected and placed in the sorted partition, while the unsorted partition gets reduced. This process continues until the entire array is sorted.
